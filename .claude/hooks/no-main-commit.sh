#!/usr/bin/env bash
# PreToolUse[Bash] guard: never commit on the main branch.
#
# AGENTS.md section 3 is explicit - work happens on a short-lived branch, never
# straight on main. This hook is the code that makes that a rule instead of a
# request, for one tool: Claude Code. Codex, Cursor and a human typing in a
# terminal never run it - for them the rule binds by being read. Honesty about
# what a guard actually covers is part of the guard.
#
# WHICH REPOSITORY A COMMIT TARGETS. A guard must enumerate every syntactic form
# of the operation it restricts: `cd <dir> && git commit`, `git -C <dir> commit`,
# `git --git-dir=<dir>/.git --work-tree=<dir> commit` and a bare `git commit`.
# Only the commit's own invocation and a `cd` before it choose the repository
# (`git -C <other> status && git commit` judges the commit, not the status), and
# git itself resolves those options. Everything is judged from the SESSION's
# directory, which the event carries as `cwd`. The hook process itself runs in the project folder, and in a desktop
# app session that is not where the session works (each session has its own
# worktree), so judging the process directory refuses honest work.
#
# EXIT CODES MATTER: in Claude Code hooks, ONLY exit 2 blocks the action.
# Exit 1 is a non-blocking error and the action proceeds. Fails OPEN by design:
# an unparseable payload, or a directory the hook cannot resolve (a shell
# variable such as "$DIR"), must never become an unexplained refusal.
# Fixtures: tests/hooks/no-main-commit.test.ts.
