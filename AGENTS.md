# Agent instructions

> **Audience:** any AI coding agent working in this repository - Claude Code, Codex
> CLI, Cursor, or whatever comes next.
> **Read this top to bottom before doing anything.**

This file is the entry point. It is deliberately short. The detail lives in
`rules/`, and you load a rule when you are about to do the thing it governs.

---

## 0. Start here, every session

Run `/start`. It loads the project context: what this is, what state it is in, and
what was last worked on. If you have not run it, you do not have enough context to
act, no matter how obvious the request looks. The one exception is a person's
first session with this template: when they ask for `/onboarding`, run that
instead; it checks the tools first and runs `/start` as soon as node, npm,
git and jq work.

When you finish, run `/save`. It writes down what happened so the next session - which
will remember nothing - can pick up where you left off.

Somebody new to this template? `/onboarding` walks them through it once: who does
what between them and the agent, the one-time setup, how a change travels from an
idea to a merge, and the security habits.

## 1. The two gates, in order

Every line of code passes both, in this order, before anything else applies.

**Gate 1: LESS IS MORE.** You may not write a single unnecessary character. Before
adding anything, answer: which real behaviour breaks without it, is the scenario
observed or invented, and does a mechanism already exist. Never build a defence for
an invented scenario - report it in one sentence instead. Detail: `rules/less-is-more.md`.

**Gate 2: FACTS ONLY.** Never guess. You may not state a cause or a mechanism you
have not read - in this code, in the dependency's source, in the vendor's docs, in a
log, or in a request you actually made. A claim without a citation does not get
written. Detail: `rules/facts-only.md`.

These two outrank everything below, including your own sense of thoroughness.

---

## 2. Before you build

**Do exactly what was asked.** When somebody says "do it like this", build that -
not that plus an improvement you thought of. A doubt is a question asked before
building, never a silent substitution. Detail: `rules/do-exactly-what-was-asked.md`.

**Ask first, if the answer changes the work.** If two readings of a request lead to
materially different code, ask. One question at a time, with the options laid out and
a recommendation. "Which do you prefer?" with no options is not a question.

**But check whether you can answer it yourself first.** You have a shell, the
repository and the tools. A question you could settle with one command costs somebody
their attention and buys nothing. Ask only about things the system cannot tell you:
what somebody WANTS, which trade-off they prefer, whether a scenario is real.

**Read the decision log.** `docs/adr/`, when it exists, holds settled rulings. Before changing
something in an area an ADR governs, read it and follow it. If it needs to change,
write a new one that supersedes it. Never silently re-decide.

**Interview before a larger change.** `/grill-me` turns a vague request into a
brief; `/grill-with-docs` does the same and records decisions (ADRs) and terms
(`GLOSSARY.md`) as they settle. For the shape of a new module, `/codebase-design`
gives the vocabulary; `/improve-codebase-architecture` looks for modules worth
deepening in code that already exists.

**Debug with a loop, not a theory.** When something is broken, failing or slow,
`/diagnosing-bugs` first builds one command that reproduces the exact symptom,
then ranks hypotheses, changes one thing at a time, and lands the fix with a
regression test wherever a test can reach the bug (when none can, it says so).

## 3. How work ships

- Work on a short-lived branch. Never commit straight to the main branch. For
  Claude Code a hook refuses it (`.claude/hooks/no-main-commit.sh` - only exit 2
  blocks); for every tool and person, `.githooks/pre-push` refuses a push to main.
- Run the full check before every commit: `npm run verify`. All of it green, no
  exceptions, and never remove or weaken a check to make it pass. `.githooks/pre-push` runs
  it again and refuses to push a red commit when that commit is your clean
  checkout (otherwise it prints NOT VERIFIED and CI is the check);
  `.githooks/pre-commit` scans staged changes for secrets when gitleaks is
  installed. Both are enabled by `npm ci` in a git checkout (not in a copy
  downloaded as a ZIP), and `--no-verify` on a commit or a push
  skips them - a decision, never a habit.
- Before a change merges, it gets **TWO review passes**, each
  by a mind that did not write it. An author checks whether the code does what they
  intended; a reviewer checks whether the intention was right. One mind does not ask
  both questions at once.
  1. **Logic pass** - does it do the right thing, and what did the author not think
     to check.
  2. **Security pass** - only holes: input reaching a request or the page unescaped,
     a secret in code or config, data sent where the user did not ask, a public
     endpoint a stranger could abuse.

  Run both with `/cross-review` (`scripts/review.sh`). It runs the logic pass on the
  tool that did NOT write the change (Codex for Claude-written work, Claude for
  Codex-written work) and the security pass on Codex (on Claude when Codex wrote
  the change), each following its agent
  file in `.claude/agents/`, on the exact commit, and records both verdicts for
  that commit. A new commit needs a new review. Without a second tool both passes
  run on the one you have, and the record says so. It runs the branch's own
  `npm run verify` here, so use it on your own and your agents' work only, never
  on a branch from somebody you do not trust - which is never even checked out,
  because switching to a branch runs the git hooks it carries. What a finding
  is worth, and how to decline one: `rules/review-calibration.md`. Honesty about what holds
  this: `.githooks/pre-push` WARNS when the pushed commit has no two-SHIP review;
  it never refuses. Merging unreviewed work is a choice, not an accident.
- Two more agents are helpers, not gates: `.claude/agents/researcher.md` checks a
  fact against the live source before it gets written down, and
  `.claude/agents/ux-reviewer.md` walks a UI change as a person seeing the screen
  for the first time.
- Merge after both SHIPs and the person's "go". Both verdict lines, and the
  reason for every declined finding, go where the merge is recorded: the pull
  request, or the merge commit message of a local project. Where the merge
  happens depends on what kind of project this is; read it from the repository,
  never ask them to clone or download anything again:
  - **Local project** (the default: no `origin`, or `origin` is the template's
    own repository): merge the branch into `main` on this machine
    (`git merge --no-ff <branch>`). No push, no pull request, no CI, no server,
    no staging. Nothing is pushed, so `.githooks/pre-push` never runs here:
    `npm run verify` before each commit and `/cross-review` before each merge are the
    gates.
  - **Project on GitHub** (`origin` is the person's own repository): push the
    branch and open a pull request; CI runs the same checks there; merge after
    green checks.
  - **Project online**: only when the person asks for it. `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`
    holds the rules that do not depend on the host (a project people rely on
    gets staging before production) and the per-host notes, Vercel being one
    option among many.
- Then verify the running result, not the pipeline's opinion of it.

**A green pipeline proves the assertions somebody wrote. It says nothing about the
behaviours nobody thought to assert.** See `rules/what-checks-prove.md`.

## 4. Secrets

No key, token, password or connection string goes in a file that gets committed.
Not in code, not in config, not in a comment, not echoed into a log. If one ever
touches version control, it is burned and must be replaced - history is permanent.
Detail: `rules/secrets.md`.

---

## 5. Shape of the code

One domain module owns one job and hides how it does it. Callers use a small,
deliberate interface and never reach inside. A business rule lives in exactly ONE
place; if you find yourself writing the same decision in a second file, that is a
defect, not thoroughness.

This branch has no domain module yet - see section 8. The `example` branch's
`src/report-triage/` is a worked instance of the principle: it owns what a verdict
is, which verdict may follow which, what a valid report looks like, and where
reports are stored, and the user interface knows none of that. Detail:
`rules/coding-standards.md` and, on that branch, `docs/adr/ADR-0001-*.md`.

---

## 6. Trust nothing until you have checked it

Not the person reporting the bug - they describe what they SAW, which is true, not
why it happened, which is a guess. Not another agent's report - agents overstate and
mark things verified that they inferred. Not your own conclusion from ten minutes ago,
written before you read the next file. Not a passing test suite.

Attack your own negative claims hardest. "Not reachable", "already covered", "cannot
happen" are the highest-value statements to be wrong about, because believing one
closes an investigation. Detail: `rules/critical-thinking.md`.

---

## 7. Writing

Plain language. No emoji. Never an en dash or em dash - use a hyphen or a colon.
Comments explain a decision that is not obvious from the code, never restate what the
line already says.

---

## 8. What this repository is

A clean workflow shell, not an application. `src/` holds a one-page placeholder and
`tests/` holds one placeholder test per harness (unit and browser), each named and
commented as something to delete once real code exists to test. There is no product
here yet - that is the point, not an oversight.

**The toolchain is ready.** TypeScript, ESLint, Vitest, Playwright and the CI
workflow all run today, against the placeholder, exactly as they will against
whatever gets built here next. `npm run verify` passing on a fresh clone is a fact
about the harness, not about a feature.

**The `example` branch holds a finished worked example** - a small phishing-report
triage queue, built with this same workflow end to end. Look there to see what a
finished change through this process looks like before you build your own.
