# write the change, on the exact commit you are about to push.
#
#   scripts/review.sh <claude|codex|other> <base-ref> "<user outcome>"
#
# The first argument names who WROTE the change (`other` for another agent or a
# person). The logic pass runs on the
# other one (a different model has different blind spots); the security pass
# runs on Codex. When the other tool is not installed, both passes fall back to
# the one you have, and the record says so: a same-tool review is better than
# none, and worse than an independent one.
#
# Each pass follows its instructions in .claude/agents/ (reviewer.md and
# security-reviewer.md), so the agents and this script never disagree.
#
# Evidence goes to <git common dir>/review-evidence/<sha>/ - outside the working
# tree, shared by every worktree, never committed. Any new commit has a new SHA
# and therefore no evidence: the review is of a commit, not of a branch.
#
# Environment: REVIEW_CODEX_MODEL and REVIEW_CLAUDE_MODEL pick a model (default:
# each tool's own default); REVIEW_DEADLINE_SECONDS (default 2400) turns a hung
# reviewer into a named failure instead of silence.
